# Python DevX Intro 

This repo is a copy of the template repo at [thetechcollective/py-devx-intro](https://github.com/thetechcollective/py-devx-intro/)

## Congratulations
 
**You successfully setup your copy from the [template](https://github.com/thetechcollective/py-devx-intro/) - and you are ready to work the [issues](../../issues/).**

But first a shot intro to the semantics in these issues: Each issue starts with a note of the learning goals for this particular issue. 

It could look like this:

> [!NOTE]
> **☝️  Learning goals in this issue**
> - Browse the repo content in the GitHub web based editor (≈VS Code)
> - Turn on _sync of settings_ on your user profile. 
> - Introduce an arbitrary new tool to support a standard way-of-working
> - Add the extension that supports this new standard and make it a recommendation for other repo co-users
> - `add`, `commit` and `push` your changes to git from the GitHub web based editor

The issues will have a chatty style, where the topics are discussed, explained and elaborated. If you are the fast-paced D.I.Y kinda learner, that are bothered by the chatty style, then you can scan for the actual exercises which are marked as tasks - like this:

> 🏋️‍♀️ **Exercise**
> - [x] **👉 A task in Pointed text in bold like this 👈** 

You should do what the task implies and then mark it as done. When you've checked all tasks in an issue, you close it and head on to the next.

When we show screen dumps or screen recordings we sometimes collapse them, to make the text more readable: Click on the black triangle `▶️` to toggle expand/collapse like shown in the example here below:

Some times there are tips that you might not want to miss, even if you just skim read the issues. We have clearly marked these tips like this:
 
> [!TIP]
> Remember, these issues are yours. They are in your own replository. It's recommended that while you work the issues in this tutorial, you make it a habit to make notes-to-self in the comments to the issues. Leave a learning trail to your own future self.

And just to start you off here's another tip:

> [!TIP]
> You are not alone! You can engage with the authors of this tutorial as well as all others who took the same tutorial; come join the [tutorial discussions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/dx-intro/discussions) speak your voice if you're stuck, want to give advise or supplement, if you found an error that should be corrected or if you request a new feature.

What the heck you'll get one final tip to start you off:

> [!TIP]
> All links in GitHub issues, discussions and .md files opens _in the same tab as your current._ This is not always desired, but there is no supported way on these GitHub medias where the author can force the link to open in a new tab - which usually is the convention on external links. So you'll have to take charge of that yourself; make it a habit to hold down `^CTRL` (Windows & Linux) or `⌘COMMAND` (Mac) when you click a link that you want to open in a new tab."


That was it: now go and **👉 [Work those issues](../../issues/) 👈**
